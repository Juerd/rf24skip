"rf24skip" by Juerd Waalboer

Very simple implementation of "skip button", to skip annoying music,
designed for the Arduino Nano v3.

- Suggested use: with rf24server :-)

Connections:
- Arduino 3.3V to nRF24L01+ VCC
- Arduino GND  to nRF24L01+ GND
- Arduino   8  to nRF24L01+ CE
- Arduino  10  to nRF24L01+ CS
- Arduino  11  to nRF24L01+ MOSI
- Arduino  12  to nRF24L01+ MISO
- Arduino  13  to nRF24L01+ CLK
- Arduino GND  to button and capacitor
- Arduino   5V to battery "+" and capacitor
- Battery "-"  to button

A 1000 nF capacitor worked for me.
